## üìã About the Project

This server is based on a modified version of [`urbanterror-slim`](urbanterror-slim-sysmyks), derived from Q3e, with significant improvements for Jump mode. SpunkyBot has been adapted to be fully compatible with the Q3e server and offer simplified administration features.

### ‚ú® Server Features

- **Optimized Q3e base**: Using the Q3e engine for better performance
- **Multi-architecture**: Support for x86_64, ARM64 (Raspberry Pi 64bit)
- **DoS protection**: Enhanced security against denial of service attacks
- **Extended limits**: Support for up to 20,000 maps in a single directory
